### 💬 Hi, I'm Darren.
I'm passionate about creating software, web apps and video games.  
I dabble in many languages but my go-tos are usually C# (.NET/Unity) and JS/TS (NodeJS). 

🌱 Tippy tappy keyboard basher. Whatever that means.  
⚡ I'm also [@fuzzymannerz](https://github.com/fuzzymannerz), creating informal and educational content for [@FuzzyTekShow](https://github.com/fuzzytekshow).
